# Introduction

Internet has become a key part of our lives since its creation. So much so, that without access to the Internet, you are completely off the grid. <br>

Internet access and high-speed connection go hand in hand with the seamless flow of information, empowering individuals and businesses to explore, communicate, and innovate in the digital age.

We set ourselves to explore the quantity and quality of Argentina's Internet infrastructure. Looking at data from the years 2014 to 2022 from the official [ENACOM Website](https://datosabiertos.enacom.gob.ar/dashboards/20000/acceso-a-internet/) (National Communications Agency in Argentina)

What we did for this particular case, was to extract all the data available for us and transform it before we used it.

# Context

![Logo](./assets/images/logo.jpg)

#### In this project, we simulate the role of a Data Analyst for a company called '**Glide**'. We were hired by the company to gather data about what difficulties Argentina faces and how can we turn the odds in the country's favour as well as the company's.

<br>

# Objectives

#### Glide's main goal is to focus all efforts on getting a 2% raise on Internet access on the next quarter per 100 inhabitants for each province. Apart from that, another vital target is to increase the number of wireless connection. Despite being one of the most popular technologies, the lack of wireless networks in Argentina is surprisingly high, especially in the northern part of the country.

#### To achieve this, we measured two different KPIs:

1. KPI = ((newAccess - currentAccess) / currentAccess) * 100
   where:

- `newAccess` refers to the number of households with Internet access after the next quarter
- `currentAccess` refers to the number of households with internet access in the present quarter

2. KPI = ((nextQuarterWirelessConnection - currentQuarterWirelessConnection) / currentQuarterWirelessConnection) * 100
